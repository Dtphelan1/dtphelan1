- Research Problem: First Past The Post elections can limit the representativeness of minority populations in US elections, and research shows that Ranked Choice Voting can alleviate underrepresentation for minority populations among elected officals. But how can we show, for a particular kind of voting body, the impact that RCV might have on the representativeness of elections 
- Solution: Worked with Researchers at Tufts' Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group to build a web application for running simulations of 
- Technology Used: 
  - React/Bootstrap v4 for the web application;
  - GitHub Pages for hosting;

### Gerrymandering Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation: Using Graphs and Simulation to Identify Gerrymandering, Spring 2020

- Mirroring the work of the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group, this project explores one way of quantifying the likelihood a  district is gerrymandered. Using at Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, this tool exploring how districts would typically be redistricted using MGGG's novel method of district-generation, Recombination (ReCom), in order to quantify the atypical-ness of a proposed redistricting map.
- A single python application, some python libraries

## Work Experience

### RTTD Web Application Prototype (5 weeks)

- Role: Technical Lead
- Problem: The CodeX FHIR Accelerator's Radiation Therapy Treatment Data (RTTD) team needs feedback from oncology SMEs on the RTTD datamodels they've created, to ensure they're capturing the right data for treating cancer with radiation therapy. But reviewing raw-JSON objects is prohibitive for non-technical people, and can devolve into discussions about non-critical metadata instead of key data elements. 
- Solution: Create a web application that can fetch RTTD JSON objects and visualize key RTTD data elements, and create it in time for the next feedback session with oncology SMEs (3 weeks of runway)
  - In two weeks, our team developed and published a prototype web application visualizing FHIR data elements in a human-readable table format to facilitate review of the Radio Therapy Treatment Data FHIR Implementation Guide created by MITRE's CodeX. We had the chance to review this application with the MITRE RTTD team leads, soliciting initial feedback from them, and providing a second iteration of the web application within 2 additional days. Deadline was met and the feedback session was _________________________
- Impact: Lifted the conversation with Oncology/Radiotherapy experts up from abstract terminology modelling and into the realm of "what information needs to be modelled to treat cancer with radiotherapy?"
- Technologies: 
  - React (Create-React App) for our web framework
  - Tailwind CSS for the styling
  - Husky/Prettier/ESlint to reduce time spent pontificating on code styling
  - GitHub Pages for publication (with GitHub workflows for automated deployment)
