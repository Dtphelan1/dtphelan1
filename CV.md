### RTTD Web Application Prototype

- Role: Technical Lead and Lead UI Developer 
- Problem: The CodeX FHIR Accelerator's Radiation Therapy Treatment Data (RTTD) team needs feedback from oncology SMEs on the RTTD datamodels they've created, to ensure they're capturing the right data for treating cancer with radiation therapy. But reviewing raw-JSON objects is prohibitive for non-technical people, and can devolve into discussions about non-critical metadata instead of key data elements. 
- Solution: Create a web application that can fetch RTTD JSON objects and visualize key RTTD data elements, and create it in time for the next feedback session with oncology SMEs (3 weeks of runway)
  - In two weeks, our team developed and published a prototype web application visualizing FHIR data elements in a human-readable table format to facilitate review of the Radio Therapy Treatment Data FHIR Implementation Guide created by MITRE's CodeX. We had the chance to review this application with the MITRE RTTD team leads, soliciting initial feedback from them, and providing a second iteration of the web application within 2 additional days. Deadline was met and the feedback session was _________________________
- Impact: Lifted the conversation with Oncology/Radiotherapy experts up from abstract terminology modelling and into the realm of "what information needs to be modelled to treat cancer with radiotherapy?"
