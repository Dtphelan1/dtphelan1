- Demo: https://mggg.github.io/rcv-webapp/#/
- Role: Lead Designer and Full Stack Developer.
- Research Problem: First Past The Post elections can limit the representativeness of minority populations in US elections, and research shows that Ranked Choice Voting can alleviate underrepresentation for minority populations among elected. But how can we show, for a particular kind of voting body, the impact that RCV might have on the representativeness of elections? 
- Approach: Worked with Researchers at Tufts' Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group to improve their current web application for running simulations of RCV elections.

- Demo: https://dtphelan1.github.io/elections/ 
- Role: Solo Project
- Problem: Many Americans express frustration with our country's two-party system, but it's our country's most common voting technique, First Past The Post, that contributes to many of the voting behaviors that lead to this frustrating outcome. 
- Approach: Leveraging basic graph theory, I've created a visual webpage breaking-down aspects of voting theory, tournaments in graph theory, and the virtues of/downsides to different voting systems. With this, we can better understand what fairer elections might look like, what new problems we might introduce with new systems, and how to channel our frustrations into policy recommendations in the future.
- Technology Used
  - React/SASS for the webpage's content;
  - GitHub Pages for Hosting;

### DONE [Gerrymandering Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation](https://github.com/Dtphelan1/gerrymandering-mcmc): Using Graphs and Simulation to Identify Gerrymandering, Spring 2020

- Code: https://github.com/Dtphelan1/gerrymandering-mcmc 
- Role: Solo Project
- Problem: Gerrymandering, the redrawing of voting maps to favor certain outcomes, is hard to identify quantifiably, but throwing out gerrymandered maps is critical to the fairness and security of truly democratic elections.
- Approach: Mirroring the work of the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group, this project explores one way of quantifying the likelihood a district map is gerrymandered. Using at Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, this tool exploring how districts would typically be redistricted using MGGG's novel method of district-generation, Recombination (ReCom), in order to quantify the atypical-ness of a proposed redistricting map.
- This is not original work, and is a reimplementation of novel research done by Tufts' MGGG lab.
- Technologies Used: 
  - Python for computations, matplotlib for plotting outcomes
