### Hi, I'm Dylan! 👋

My name is Dylan Phelan (he/him) and I'm a 🧑‍💻 senior software engineer [@MITRE](https://github.com/MITRE) with +5 years of experience in full-stack development on 🏥 Health IT projects. I'm passionate about problems in public sector and healthcare domains, using my skills in 🕸web-development, 📈data visualization, and 👨‍🎨UI/UX design to build tools that help people make effective decisions. In May 2021, I received my CS Master's from Tufts University, where my study focused on 🤖 AI/ML and ⚖️ AI Ethics for public sector and healthcare applications.


- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving oncology care through healthcare standards like FHIR and mCODE – check out our work on the [mCODE Extraction Framework](https://github.com/mcode/mcode-extraction-framework).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about systemic problems of fairness, accountability, transparency, power, and ethics in algorithmic systems – and what technologists, regulators, and citizens can do to address them.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on local data transparency projects like my recent work on visualizing [Arlington Town Meeting Member voting histories](https://github.com/Dtphelan1/arlington-ma-town-member-voting) with [@GrahamGoudeau](https://github.com/GrahamGoudeau) and [@mgramigna](https://github.com/mgramigna)!
