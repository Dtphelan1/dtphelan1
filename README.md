### Hi, I'm Dylan! 👋

My name is Dylan Phelan (he/him) and I'm a 🧑‍💻 senior web developer at Boston Children's [@smart-on-fhir](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/) team with +6 years of experience in full-stack development on 🏥 Health IT projects. I'm passionate about problems in public sector and healthcare domains, using my skills in 🕸web-development, 📈data visualization, and 👨‍🎨UI/UX design to build web tools that enable healthcare standards developement. In May 2021, I received my CS Master's from Tufts University, where my study focused on 🤖 AI/ML and ⚖️ AI Ethics for public sector and healthcare applications.


- I'm currently creating reference implementations envisioning how patients can access their electronic health information using FHIR's EHI Export API standard – learn [more here](https://ehi-app.herokuapp.com/). 
- 🏥 Currently [@SMART-on-FHIR](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir) working on healthcare data standards via FHIR reference implementations & implementation guides, writing papers on the importance of those standards, and experimenting with LLMs to understand their implications in healthcare. 
- 🔭 Previously [@MITRE](https://github.com/mitre), I was improving oncology through healthcare standards like FHIR and mCODE – check out our work on the [mCODE Extraction Framework](https://github.com/mcode/mcode-extraction-framework).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about systemic problems of fairness, accountability, transparency, power, and ethics in healthcare algorithms – and what technologists, regulators, and citizens can do to address them.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on local data transparency projects like my work on visualizing [Arlington Town Meeting Member voting histories](https://github.com/Dtphelan1/arlington-ma-town-member-voting) with [@GrahamGoudeau](https://github.com/GrahamGoudeau) and [@mgramigna](https://github.com/mgramigna)!
